        <p>Yesterday, you asked me how i feeel when i do not talk to you and i said i can't relate but now i can relate cause i'm badly missing you and you know you could have just dropped a message that you'd be busy the whole day.</p>
        <p>Always Remember that marvelous loves you so much and she wouldn't trade you for anything </p>
        <p>Thank you for making me be the better version of myself and thank you for always been there for me when i need you and thank you for caring for me</p>
        <p>i know i might be childish at times but thank you for being that matured guy that loves peace, but sometimes i just feel bad to have stressed you that much for almost 3 years before i could accept to go into a relationship with you all because i couldn't admit i was in love with you cause i thought it was just a clear friendship but later realized its more than that </p>
